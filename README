 - Two players should be able to play the game sitting at the same computer
 - The board should be printed out every time a player makes a move
 - You should be able to accept input of the player position and then place a symbole on the board 
 - We will use a "numpad" to match numbers to the grid on the tic tac toe board. Ex:
 [7,8,9]
 [4,5,6]
 [1,2,3]
